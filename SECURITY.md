At Hiro, we are dedicated to building developer tools for the Stacks blockchain, which enables apps and smart contracts on Bitcoin.

If you have discovered a bug or vulnerability in any of our products, we encourage you to [report it at our Hacker One program](https://hackerone.com/hiro). 

We will work closely with you to investigate and resolve the issue promptly.
